# E-Commerce Microservices Application

## 1. About the Project
This project is a backend **E-Commerce application built using Spring Boot microservices**.  
It follows an industry-standard architecture using **service discovery, asynchronous messaging, and loosely coupled services**.  
The application is developed incrementally, and only stable, working features are pushed to the repository.

## 2. Project Structure

1. **Eureka Discovery Server**  
   Service registry that enables dynamic discovery of all microservices.

2. **API Gateway**  
   Central entry point for routing requests to microservices (security integration planned).

3. **Auth Service**  
   Handles authentication and authorization (Spring Security integration planned).

4. **Product Service**  
   Manages product information and inventory.

5. **Order Service**  
   Handles order creation and publishes order events to Kafka.

6. **Payment Service**  
   Consumes order events from Kafka and processes payments.

7. **Notification Service** *(planned)*  
   Listens to payment events and handles user notifications.

## 5. Kafka & Zookeeper

- **Apache Kafka** is used for asynchronous, event-driven communication.
- **Zookeeper** is used for Kafka cluster coordination.
- Current Kafka topic:
  - `order-created` (produced by Order Service, consumed by Payment Service)

---

## 6. Redis

- Redis is planned for:
  - Caching frequently accessed data (products)
  - Session management during Spring Security integration

---

## 7. Current Status

- Eureka service discovery working
- Kafka producer and consumer working
- Order → Payment event flow verified
- Security temporarily disabled for faster development
